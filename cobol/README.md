# Simple Mastermind (COBOL version)
Simple player vs computer Mastermind clone, in COBOL.

Source code uses the older fixed format (and not the more modern free format, thus it doesn't require the `-free` flag during compilation)
## How to use
Install open-cobol
```bash
$ sudo apt install open-cobol
```
Compile source
```bash
$ cobc -x mastermind.cob
```
Run
```bash
$ ./mastermind
```
